## What is it?

Branhack is a great place to connect with like-minded individuals.
This year we would like to create a study group-like environment to help participants who would like to obtain some hacking skills!
Brainhack School has provided quality self-paced study content on various topics.
Find some friends who want to learn about the same topic and help each other out!
Don’t be shy, reach out to other brainhackers in person or through discords!

## Requirements

- Find some skills you want to learn.
- Willingness to find new friends to learn together!

## What to expect

An important skill of a brainhacker is learning new things with friends.
There’s no instructors or leaders in Traintrack Corner, just like minded individuals who want to do Science!
You decide what your experience will be like.
If you are not sure how to approach people, consider joining our [Buddy System](/buddy-system/).
If you found better materials for the topics you want, why not try to submit a pull request to add a link to the content?

## Suggested topics

Here is a list of suggested topics with tutorials.
You can explore one topic that suits you at Braihack!
